===========

Be plexable.

Plexability is licensed under
[GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2](GPLv2-LICENSE.md) or later.

While I'd like to provide a more permissive license, Plexability makes use of -
and builds upon - several great GPL-licensed libraries.  Of particular note:

* [XBMC (and Plex)](http://xbmc.org/team-xbmc/2003/10/31/please-respect-the-gpl-license/)
* [ffmpeg and it's GPL-licensed codecs](http://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html)
